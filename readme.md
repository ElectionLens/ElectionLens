## 🌟 Overview

Election Lens provides a unified interface to navigate India's complex electoral geography - from states down to individual polling booths. Unlike fragmented online resources, this tool connects all levels of electoral boundaries with detailed election results in a single, fast, mobile-friendly application.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🗺️ Multi-Level Drill-Down Navigation
- **India → State → Parliamentary Constituency → Assembly Constituency → Booths**
- **India → State → District → Assembly Constituency**
- 5 levels of hierarchical navigation with seamless animated transitions

### 📊 Booth-wise Election Analysis (NEW in v3.0)
- **Booth Distribution** - Visual bar showing party-wise booth wins
- **Booths Won by Party** - Expandable cards with detailed booth lists
- **Key Insights** - AI-generated analysis of voting patterns
- **Party Strike Rates** - Conversion rates from contests to wins
- **Quick Stats** - Landslides, battlegrounds, high NOTA, women's booths

### 🎯 Data quality (TN 2026)
- **234/234 ACs** with official totals reconciled (`booth + postal = official` per candidate)
- **Zero unmapped** — extraction gaps are distributed to booth rows, not held in a separate bucket
- Form20 postal kept honest (~0.4% median); per-booth badges show Form20 vs estimated fill

### 🗳️ Election Results
- **Parliamentary Elections** (2009-2024) with AC-wise breakdown
- **Assembly Elections** for all states with complete candidate data
- **Booth-wise Results** for Tamil Nadu 2021

### 🗳️ Dual View System
- Toggle between **Parliamentary Constituencies (543 Lok Sabha seats)** and **District boundaries** for any state
- Single toggle to switch views while maintaining context

### 🏛️ Assembly Constituency Drill-Down
- Click any **Parliamentary Constituency** → See its component Assembly segments
- Click any **District** → See its component Assembly segments
- PC-to-AC and District-to-AC mapping in one tool

### 🔍 Smart Search
- Search across states, parliamentary constituencies, and assembly constituencies
- Keyboard navigation with Arrow keys and Enter to select
- Type-ahead filtering with instant results

### 📊 Smart Data Mapping

  - Telangana's 21 new districts (2016)
  - Tamil Nadu's 8 new districts (2019-2020)
  - Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, UP, and more
- Maps new districts to parent districts for accurate assembly data

### 💾 Offline-First Architecture

- **Works completely offline** after first load
- Fast subsequent loads from local cache
- Background preloading of all state data

### 📱 Fully Responsive Design
- Collapsible sidebar for mobile devices
- Touch-optimized map interactions
- PWA-ready with proper meta tags
