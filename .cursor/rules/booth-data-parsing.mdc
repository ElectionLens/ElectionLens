# Booth Data Parsing Rules

When parsing election booth data from PDFs (via OCR, pdftotext, or any extraction method), follow these validation rules to catch parsing errors.

## Critical: Detect Booth Number in Votes Array

The most common parsing bug: booth numbers accidentally appearing in the votes array.

```python
# ❌ BAD - No validation, booth number leaks into votes
votes = [int(n) for n in numbers[vote_start:]][:num_candidates]

# ✅ GOOD - Validate votes don't match booth patterns
def validate_booth_votes(booth_no: int, votes: list[int]) -> bool:
    # Check if any vote suspiciously matches booth number
    if booth_no in votes[:3]:  # First 3 columns most likely to have error
        return False
    # Check for sequential booth numbers in votes (parsing shift error)
    if len(votes) >= 2 and votes[0] == 0 and 1 <= votes[1] <= 600:
        return False  # Likely booth number in wrong position
    return True
```

## Required Validations

### 1. Cross-validate against official totals
Always compare extracted column sums against official constituency totals:

```python
# Sum votes per candidate across all booths
col_sums = [sum(r['votes'][i] for r in results.values()) for i in range(num_candidates)]

# Compare to official totals - should be within 5% (some booths may be missing)
for i, candidate in enumerate(official_candidates[:3]):
    ratio = col_sums[i] / candidate['votes']
    if not (0.80 <= ratio <= 1.20):
        raise ValidationError(f"{candidate['party']}: extracted {col_sums[i]:,} vs official {candidate['votes']:,}")
```

### 2. Validate booth winner distribution
The top 2 parties by booth wins should match the top 2 by votes:

```python
# Count booth wins
booth_wins = Counter(max(range(len(r['votes'])), key=lambda i: r['votes'][i]) 
                     for r in results.values())

# Map to parties and compare
top_2_by_wins = {candidates[i]['party'] for i, _ in booth_wins.most_common(2)}
top_2_official = {c['party'] for c in official_candidates[:2]}

if top_2_by_wins != top_2_official:
    raise ValidationError(f"Winner mismatch: extracted {top_2_by_wins} vs official {top_2_official}")
```

### 3. Sanity check vote values
```python
def validate_vote_value(vote: int, total_electors: int = 2000) -> bool:
    # Single booth rarely has >2000 votes
    if vote > total_electors:
        return False
    # Negative votes impossible
    if vote < 0:
        return False
    return True
```

## PDF Column Mapping

Election PDFs often have these columns that should NOT be in votes array:
- **Sl. No** - Serial number (1, 2, 3...)
- **Booth No** - Polling station number
- **Total Valid Votes** - Sum column (exclude from candidate votes)
- **Rejected Votes** - Separate field
- **NOTA** - May or may not be included as last candidate

When parsing columns, explicitly identify and skip non-vote columns before extracting candidate votes.
